#### General 
- We'll be looking at the combination of using Aider and DeepSeek-R1 to make accelerated progress on our opensource codebase. 
- If you're interested in what other people are saying check out this thread https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42852866. 
- If you don't know how to use these...no problem! We barely know (and 99% of other devs don't yet) we'll get you setup, see below if you want to try to setup yourself.

#### Setting up Aider + LLM-API
- Install Aider following this guide: https://aider.chat/docs/install.html
- Add a key to your existing LLM provider as explained in the guide.
- If you don't have an existing one I'll be happy to provide you one with limited credits via OpenRouter
